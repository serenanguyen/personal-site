				<img src="assets/images/me.png" alt="me" id="me">
				<p id= "first">I'm from Houston, Texas but moved to Austin for school.  I graduated from the University of Texas with a biology degree with a concentration in evolution, ecology, and behaviors.</p>
				<p>In my free time I volunteer at a wildlife rehab where I get to take care of injured animals until they can be released. I also like to lift and climb.</p>
				<p>While working in operations at a tech company I became interested in becoming a QA.  I began learning QA automation which got me interested in coding.  I worked through online modules to learn basic html, css, javascript.  It has been extremely exciting for me to learn material completely new to me as well as create exciting projects. I am currently a student at the UT Coding BootCamp with the intention of becoming a full-stack developer by the end of May 2017.</p>
